## üóÉÔ∏è Overview

In the era of big data, real-time analytics, and highly scalable applications, traditional relational databases often fall short due to rigid schema constraints, limited scalability, and slower performance under high-concurrency workloads. As a response to these challenges, **NoSQL (Not Only SQL)** databases emerged ‚Äî a family of database systems purpose-built to manage large volumes of semi-structured, unstructured, and rapidly changing data.

Unlike relational databases, which rely on fixed schemas and SQL for querying, NoSQL systems prioritize **flexibility**, **scalability**, and **performance**, making them well-suited for modern application architectures such as microservices, distributed systems, and cloud-native applications.

### ‚úÖ Why NoSQL?

NoSQL databases are designed to:

- Handle **massive amounts of data** across distributed clusters.
- Support **dynamic and flexible schemas**, adapting to rapidly evolving data models.
- Optimize for **horizontal scalability**, allowing data to be distributed across many machines.
- Enable **fast reads and writes** for real-time use cases like caching, IoT telemetry, analytics, and user personalization.
- Store **diverse types of data**, including documents, key-value pairs, graphs, and wide-column structures ‚Äî each suited to specific workloads.

These features have made NoSQL databases an essential component in domains such as social networking, content management, recommendation systems, and time-series analysis.

## üìå Core Characteristics of NoSQL Databases

NoSQL systems share several fundamental traits that distinguish them from traditional databases:

- **üîÑ Schema Flexibility**  
  NoSQL databases support schema-less or dynamic schemas, meaning data can be inserted without predefined structures. This flexibility simplifies handling evolving datasets, especially in agile or prototyping environments.

- **‚öñÔ∏è Horizontal Scalability**  
  Many NoSQL systems are designed for distributed environments. They scale "out" rather than "up" ‚Äî distributing data across multiple nodes for improved load handling and fault tolerance.

- **üöÄ High Performance**  
  By relaxing ACID guarantees when appropriate (often favoring eventual consistency), NoSQL databases deliver high throughput and low latency for both reads and writes.

- **üß© Variety of Data Models**  
  NoSQL is not a single technology ‚Äî it includes multiple categories:
  - **Key-Value Stores** (e.g., Redis, Riak): Simple and fast, used for caching and session data.
  - **Document Stores** (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB): Store JSON-like structures; great for content management and user data.
  - **Column-Family Stores** (e.g., Cassandra, HBase): Optimized for analytics over large datasets.
  - **Graph Databases** (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB): Ideal for highly connected data like social networks or fraud detection.

- **üõ°Ô∏è Built-In Fault Tolerance and Replication**  
  Most NoSQL databases support built-in data replication and partitioning to ensure durability and availability even under node failures.

- **üß™ Support for Probabilistic and Analytical Operations**  
  Many modern implementations also integrate lightweight structures like **Bloom Filters**, **Count-Min Sketches**, and **HyperLogLogs** for efficient approximate computations over large data streams.

## üóÇÔ∏è Types of NoSQL Databases

NoSQL systems are broadly classified into the following categories:

1. **üîë Key-Value Stores**  
   - Store data as key-value pairs.  
   - Best for simple queries and high-speed lookups.  
   - Examples: Redis, DynamoDB, RocksDB  

2. **üìÑ Document Stores**  
   - Store semi-structured data as JSON/BSON-like documents.  
   - Ideal for hierarchical and nested data.  
   - Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB  

3. **üìä Column-Family Stores**  
   - Organize data into rows and columns within families.  
   - Used for analytics, wide tables, and time-series data.  
   - Examples: Apache Cassandra, HBase  

4. **üîó Graph Databases**  
   - Model entities and their relationships as nodes and edges.  
   - Powerful for traversals and complex relationship queries.  
   - Examples: Neo4j, ArangoDB  

Each type offers a different trade-off and is optimized for specific data access patterns and use cases.

## üß† When to Use NoSQL?

NoSQL is not a one-size-fits-all solution ‚Äî but it excels in scenarios such as:

- When you need to ingest **huge amounts of data quickly**
- When your application requires **real-time analytics** or **high throughput**
- When your data model is **frequently evolving**
- When you need to scale **horizontally and elastically**
- When your workload is write-heavy and requires **eventual consistency** over strict ACID guarantees

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to **design and implement a fully functional NoSQL key-value storage engine** from scratch ‚Äî modeled after modern high-performance storage systems such as **LevelDB**, **RocksDB**, and **Apache Cassandra**.

This system is developed with an emphasis on **modularity, configurability, and extensibility**, allowing it to serve both as a practical engine and a learning framework for exploring the internals of real-world NoSQL databases.

Through the careful construction of this system, the project explores a wide range of core components commonly found in production-grade NoSQL engines. These include:

- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** with integrity checks and segment management  
- **In-memory Memtables** with support for HashMap, Skip List, or B-Tree structures  
- **SSTable generation**, including Data, Index, Summary, Filter, Metadata, and TOC components  
- **LSM-tree organization** with configurable compaction strategies (size-tiered and leveled)  
- **Block Manager and Block Cache** for paged I/O operations  
- **LRU-based Cache** for accelerating reads  
- **Probabilistic structures** such as Bloom Filter, Count-Min Sketch, HyperLogLog, and SimHash  
- **Support for scans and iterators**, including paginated prefix and range queries  
- **Rate limiting** via the Token Bucket algorithm  
- **Configuration via external files**, ensuring full modularity and flexibility

This comprehensive foundation reflects not only how data flows through a NoSQL engine ‚Äî from ingestion to durable storage and retrieval ‚Äî but also how complex systems balance performance, correctness, and extensibility.

All of these components are explored in greater depth throughout the remainder of this document.


- How persistent key-value storage is structured and maintained
- How efficient reads are achieved in large-scale systems
- How write-intensive workloads are optimized via batching and compaction
- How probabilistic and compressed structures enhance performance and scalability

By building this engine end-to-end, we aim to provide insight into the architecture and mechanics of modern NoSQL systems ‚Äî including **data ingestion, organization, indexing, fault tolerance, and approximate querying** ‚Äî all while maintaining control over every layer of the data path.
